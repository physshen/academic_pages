abstract: The search for exotic superconductors with high transition temperature (Tc ) is a challenging task in condensed matter physics and materials science1,2 . Among them, the ferromagnetic superconductors with time-reversal symmetry breaking could display intrinsic coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity, and has been extensively discussed in heavy fermions 3-8 and non-centrosymmetric compounds9,10 . The correlation between ferromagnetism and superconductivity in these materials, however, remains elusive. Here, we report an experimental observation of intrinsic ferromagnetic superconductivity in high quality spinel oxide $LiTi_{2}O_{4}$ thin films. The spontaneous ferromagnetism with time-reversal symmetry breaking is found to coincide with the onset of superconductivity at Tc  of 13 K. Furthermore, spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking from four-fold to two-fold is also observed at the verge of its superconductivity in angular resolved transverse electrical resistance. These experimental findings suggest that $LiTi_{2}O_{4}$ is an unconventional superconductor with non-unitary triplet pairing. Our work sheds new light into exploring the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in unconventional superconductors.
