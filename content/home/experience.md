  - title: Two-dimensional superconductivity at oxide interfaces 
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: ''
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-01-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        *	Grew and optimized single crystal oxide thin films on substrates with pulsed-laser deposition
        * Studied the transport and magnetic properties of the heterointerface at low temperatures
        * Helped to identify the Bose metallic state with a wide range of temperature-independent resistance associated with vanishing Hall resistance
        * Currently working in search for ferromagnetic insulator in double perovskite thin films and possible superconducting phase via voltage gating

  - title: Research on time-reversal and rotational symmetry breaking in superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: ''
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2020-09-01'
    date_end: '2020-12-20'
    description: |2-
        * Used group theory to analyze the pairing symmetry in our sample and help explain the coexistence of
           ferromagnetism and superconductivity 
        * Proposed a topological origin of the two-fold symmetry in transverse resistance, which provided a new
            explanation of similar results reported in Nature 547, 432–435 (2017) 
        * Gained rich experience in combining experiments with theories to better understand interplay between
            magnetism and superconductivity    

  - title: Research on fingerprints of Majorana zero mode in topological superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: ''
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2019-05-01'
    date_end: '2020-09-01'
    description: |2-
       * Used nonequilibrium Green’s function method (NEGF) and analytical methods to calculate the transport
         properties of p+ip and d+id superconductors 
       * Proposed that transport measurements can be utilized to identify the existence of Majorana zero mode in p+ip and d+id superconductors 
       * Received systematic training in the theory of superconductivity
  - title: Research on 2D materials and device fabrication
    company: Supervised by Prof. Faxian Xiu
    company_url: ''
    location: Nanodevice Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2018-11-01'
    date_end: '2019-05-01'
    description: |2-
        * Synthesized high quality $Bi_{2}SeO_{3}$ sample using chemical vapor deposition method (CVD)
        * Peeled off single-layered graphene for heterostructure fabrication 
        * Helped establish a platform for stacking layers of 2D materials controlled by LabView 
        * Received technical training in device fabrication and transport measurement
