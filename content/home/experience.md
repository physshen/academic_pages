  - title: STM study of moiré graphene and TMDC materials
    company: Visiting Student Researcher supervised by Prof. Michael Crommie
    company_url: 'https://crommie.berkeley.edu/'
    location: Crommie Group, UC Berkeley
    date_start: '2021-09-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        *	Learned and mastered the use of STM to image the electronic structure of materials.
        * Characterized twisted mono-bilayer graphene and TMDC samples (,$NbSe_{2}$,$TaTe_{2}$, etc.).
        * Measured the Mott behavior of monolayer 1T-$TaSe_{2}$ and Kondo resonance in 1T/1H-$TaSe_{2}$ hetero-bilayers. 
        * Discovered an exotic $\sqrt{19}\times\sqrt{19}$ charge density wave in 1T-$TaTe_{2}$.
        * 	Currently working on nontrivial topology in twisted mono-bilayer graphene and possible Tc enhancement in $NbSe_{2}/SrTiO_{3}$ heterostructure.

  - title: Ab-initio study of rare-earth oxide superconductors with nontrivial topology                 
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-07-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-30'
    description: |2-
        *	Learned and mastered first-principle calculation of electronic structures and phonon spectrum using VASP.
        * Developed python codes to study the nontrivial topology of rare-earth oxide superconductor LaO and found non-zero $Z_2$ invariant together with topologically protected surface states.
        * Analyzed the energy splitting of La orbitals in oxygen octahedron crystal fields with group theory and identified the 5d to 4f orbital transition accounts for the band inversion.
        * Co-authored paper: Electronic structure of rare-earth binary oxide superconductor LaO now under review in Physical Review B as Letter.
  
  - title: Two-dimensional superconductivity at oxide interfaces 
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-01-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        *	Grew and optimized single crystal oxide thin films on $SrTiO_{3}$ (111) substrates layer-by-layer with pulsed-laser deposition.
        * Measured the transport and magnetic properties of the heterointerface at low temperatures
        * Helped to identify the Bose metallic state with a wide range of temperature-independent resistance associated with vanishing Hall resistance.
        * Co-authored paper: Two-dimensional superconductivity at heterostructure of Mott insulating titanium sesquioxide and polar semiconductor now under review in Nature Materials.

  - title: Time-reversal and rotational symmetry breaking in superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2020-09-01'
    date_end: '2020-12-20'
    description: |2-
        * Analyzed the pairing symmetry in our sample with group theory and helped to explain the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity. 
        * Fitted STS data with the simulated LDOS spectrum of triplet-pairing superconductors using Green’s function.
        * Proposed a topological origin of the two-fold symmetry in transverse resistance, which provided a new explanation of similar results reported in Nature 547, 432–435 (2017).  
        * Gained rich experience in combining experiments with theories to better understand the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.

  - title: Fingerprints of Majorana zero mode in topological superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2019-05-01'
    date_end: '2020-09-01'
    description: |2-
       * Learned nonequilibrium Green’s function method (NEGF) and analytical methods to study the transport properties of p+ip and d+id superconductors.
       * Developed python codes to simulate Andreev reflection spectrum of metal-superconductor junctions. 
       * Studied the finite-size effects of the zero-bias conductance peaks in topological superconductors and found only quasi-one-dimensional samples can give rise to quantized conductance at $2e^{2}/h$.
