  - title: STM study of moiré graphene and TMDC materials
    company: Visiting Student Researcher supervised by Prof. Michael Crommie
    company_url: 'https://crommie.berkeley.edu/'
    location: Crommie Group, UC Berkeley
    date_start: '2021-09-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        *	Mastered STM/S to image the electronic structure of materials and took charge of an Omicron LT-STM machine.
        * Constructed a continuum model to simulate the LDOS of twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hBN.
        * Characterized twisted bilayer graphene and TMDC devices ($TaSe_{2}$, $NbSe_{2}$, $TaTe_{2}$, etc.). Studied the evolution of electronic structures with back gate.
        * Imaged the Mott insulating behavior of monolayer 1T-$TaSe_{2}$ with ‘flower pattern’ orbital texture. 
        * Proved the existence of localized spins by observing Kondo resonance peak in the STS spectra of 1T/1H-$TaSe_{2}$.
        * Discovered an exotic $\sqrt{19}\times\sqrt{19}$ charge density wave in 1T-$TaTe_{2}$.
        * Currently working on nontrivial topology in twisted mono-bilayer graphene and possible Tc enhancement in $NbSe_{2}/SrTiO_{3}$ heterostructure.

  - title: Ab-initio study of rare-earth oxide superconductors with nontrivial topology                 
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-05-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-20'
    description: |2-
        *	Learned and mastered first-principle calculation of electronic structures and phonon spectrum using VASP.
        * Developed python codes to study the nontrivial topology of rare-earth oxide superconductor LaO and found non-zero $Z_2$ invariant together with topologically protected surface states.
        * Analyzed the energy splitting of La orbitals in oxygen octahedron crystal fields with group theory and identified the origin of band inversion as the 5d to 4f orbital transition.
     
  
  - title: Unconventional superconductivity in oxide heterostructures
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2020-04-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-25'
    description: |2-
       * Grew and optimized single crystal oxide thin films $Ti_{2}O_{3}/GaN$ layer-by-layer with pulsed-laser deposition.
       * Helped to identify the Bose metallic state in $Ti_{2}O_{3}/GaN$ with temperature-independent resistance in a wide range associated with vanishing Hall resistance.
       * Analyzed the pairing symmetry in $LiTi_{2}O_{4}$ with group theory and helped to explain the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity.
       * Fitted STS data of $LiTi_{2}O_{4}$ with the calculated LDOS spectrum of triplet-pairing superconductors using Green’s function method.
       * Proposed a topological origin of the two-fold symmetry in transverse resistance of $LiTi_{2}O_{4}$, providing a new explanation for similar results reported in Nature 547, 432–435 (2017).



  - title: Theoretical study of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2019-05-01'
    date_end: '2020-04-01'
    description: |2-
       * Learned lattice Green’s function method to study the transport properties of topological superconductors.
       * Constructed a lattice model of metal-superconductor junctions and developed python codes to simulate Andreev reflection spectrum.
       * Studied the finite-size effects of the zero-bias conductance peak in topological superconductors and found that only quasi-one-dimensional materials can exhibit quantized conductance $2e^{2}/h$.

    description: |2-
        * Synthesized high quality $Bi_{2}SeO_{3}$ sample using chemical vapor deposition method (CVD)
        * Peeled off single-layered graphene for heterostructure fabrication.
