  - title: Ab-initio study of rare-earth oxide superconductors with nontrivial topology                 
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-05-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-20'
    description: |2-
        * Developed python codes to study the nontrivial topology of rare-earth oxide superconductor LaO and found non-zero $Z_2$ invariant together with topologically protected surface states.
        * Analyzed the energy splitting of La orbitals in oxygen octahedron crystal fields with group theory and identified the origin of band inversion as the 5d to 4f orbital transition.
     
  

  - title: Theoretical study of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2019-05-01'
    date_end: '2020-04-01'
    description: |2-
       * Constructed a lattice model of metal-superconductor junctions and developed python codes to simulate Andreev reflection spectrum.
       * Studied the finite-size effects of the zero-bias conductance peak in topological superconductors.
