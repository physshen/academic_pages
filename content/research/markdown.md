  ### Quantum Materials & Devices

  Our lab explores topological materials, 2D ferroelectrics, and nanoscale optoelectronic devices.

  - **Topological insulators**
  - **2D multiferroics**
  - **Semiconductor heterostructures**

  � We combine ultrafast spectroscopy, transport measurements, and first-principles simulations.
