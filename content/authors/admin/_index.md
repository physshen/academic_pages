I am a physics junior at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). My research focuses on understanding the emergent phenomena due to the interplay between charge, spin, lattice and orbital in strongly correlated electronic systems. I approach this goal by engaging in both experimental characterization of exotic materials and theoretical modeling.

My current research projects are [interfacial superconductivity]({{< ref "project/interface/index.md" >}}) and STM study of [Moiré graphene]({{< ref "project/Moiré_graphene/index.md" >}}).
