I am a Ph.D. student at MIT studying physics. I got my bachelor degree in Physics at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). My research focuses on understanding the emergent phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems. 
<!--I am interested in both experimental characterization of exotic materials and theoretical modeling.-->
